					Gratii’s mission is to harness the power of mobile technology to level the playing field between marketer and consumer. We deliver innovative marketing experiences that are effective, entertaining, and profitable for both brands and consumers.</br></br>

					We believe that a change to the marketing experience is not only necessary, but inevitable. Marketers have had the home field advantage for far too long now. As such, consumers are on the extreme defensive. Spam lists, black lists, do not call lists, interruptive ads and commercials; is this any way to win the hearts of consumers?</br></br>

					If fans are to flock back in droves, entertainment must exceed expectations. Here at Gratii, we provide the stadium to help marketers perform their best and reignite a loyal fanbase they once aimed to inspire. With the most engaging mobile rewards solution on the planet, Gratii reunites brands with consumers in a fundamentally heightened approach to digital strategy.</br></br>

					Through Gratii, marketers and consumers are settling their differences, showing their appreciation, and interacting once again. <b>#WellPlayed</b>

						<b>Role:</b> Lead company strategy and technical development.
						</br><b>Resum&eacute;:</b> UMD class of '10. B.S. Finance. Studied int'l business in Australia and Dubai. Founded event production & brand development company in '09. Gratii was bootstrapped off the success of that venture. Self-taught database architect and mobile/web developer.
						</br><b>Personal:</b> From Potomac, MD. Free-time music blogger. Played soccer for Maryland's Olympic Development Program team. Member of MENSA.
						</br><b>Fun fact:</b> Gratii comes from the Latin derivative <i>Gratis</i>, meaning "To give away for free". As clich&eacute; as it sounds, Gratii was literally started in Feldman's parents' basement. The original prototype was built in 2011 entirely in Flash and had a 3D virtual world where you controlled an avatar. It was pretty awesome!

						<b>Role:</b> Establish and maintain strategic partnerships with marketing and digital agencies.
						</br><b>Resum&eacute;:</b> Advisor, mentor, and strategist to some of the brightest CEO’s and Founders in the DC area. Serial Entrepreneur. Member of the Board for many of the hottest local starups. Khin brings over a decade of growth strategy & business development experience to Gratii.
						</br><b>Personal:</b> Khin spent his childhood years as a novice Buddhist Monk in Rangoon & Mandalay, Burma. Today, when he's not mentoring startups in his spare time, you can find him outdoors; hiking, camping, hunting, climbing, or seeking adventure traveling to far and exotic locations.
						</br><b>Fun fact:</b> Khin met Feldman in early 2013 while hosting one of his many startup networking events. Intrigued by the unique business model for Gratii, he agreed to mentor and consult Feldman pro bono. When Feldman began his search for business developers later that year, Khin jumped at the opportunity to get more hands on and take on the challenge himself.

						<b>Role:</b> Work directly with brands to improve their market intelligence and mobile strategy.
						</br><b>Resum&eacute;:</b> Serial Entrepreneur. Founder of Vaperfy. Business Development in the N.A. and LATAM regions for JReport in the business intelligence space.
						</br><b>Personal:</b>  A community advocate, Michael gives back through volunteering at A.F. & A.M. and Knights of Columbus charity events.
						</br><b>Fun fact:</b> Zumaran's initial experience with Gratii was actually as a client. After seeing a buzz about it on social media, he used Gratii to promote Vaperfy. Shocked by Gratii's ability to enhance market intelligence and rapidly deploy custom client requirements (i.e. targeted promotions), he sought Feldman out for ways to get involved directly with the company - a true testament to the power of this platform.
